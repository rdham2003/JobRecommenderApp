**üíºAbout SkillTapüíº**

While searching for jobs and internships, I've been having a recurring problem while perusing the job description: Many of these jobs do not have relative skills on my resume. This has made the search much more difficult that I had believed it to be. So I came up with my own solution: Create an application that parses skills on my resume, fetches jobs using Adzuna's open API and returns said jobs that closely match my resume. These jobs can vary depending on the skillset. For example: I personally have skills in Full-Stack Development, Data Science, DevOps, and Machine learning. So I will be recommended Full-stack Development, Data Science, DevOps, and Machine Learning jobs. This application is applicable for both graduates and undergraduates seeking full-time jobs and internships. For the design, I chose a Tinder-Style UI since I felt that it would be easier to concentrate on one job at a time rather than 50 jobs all together like you would see on Glassdoor and LinkedIn. Finally, I wanted the ability to bookmark jobs I was interested in incase I wanted to apply later on. I created an account system that holds user information and saved job information as well. Users can save jobs recommended to them and also delete them from their wishlist incase they have applied and no longer need to hold onto it. Users can optionallly select their location's country, their zip code, and also choose how close they want their jobs.

This project was not only built to help solve my problem of not finding relative jobs, but I also wanted to test out my new tech-stack that I adopted: Using a Gradle-built Spirngboot Java backend with a React.js frontend and a MongoDB database using the MongoDB Atlas. Through this project, I not only reinforced my skills of Full-Stack Development, but I was able to improve on using the Springboot framework, the Gradle build tool, the React.js framework, and client-server split applications. The reason I enjoyed using this tech stack was because of the simplicity of running a client and server on different ports as opposed to React and Flask running together. I also was able to learn about local storage and cookies through this project, improving on my mistakes of storing client information in the server and using the server to change client-side components, a feature that would heavily mess up in a production environment. 

TL;DR: I solved my problem of not finding relative jobs and became a much better developer by learning new content and improving on mistakes made in previous projects.
